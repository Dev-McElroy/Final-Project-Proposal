# Advnaced Color Selector
## General Description
The Advanced color slector I am creating for my final project will be reminicent of the color selector you would find in any digital drawing software such as photoshop of illustrator. However these tools have a few limitation that I would liek to resolve.
### Features
The features will include both replicas of the features found in colors selctors as well as my own adjustments:

Basic Features:
- The ability to enter a RGB code to produce a color in the viewport
- The ability to change the color in the viewport
- Save colors in a data set to be used for later

Features I want to add:
- The ability to look up a color by name rather than RGB code
- Name colors to personal specifications so they can retrieved easily from you saved colors
- Color camparrison. Be able to color multiple colors within teh same views without having to switch back and forth
